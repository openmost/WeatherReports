## Changelog

### v6.0.0

> **Action required after upgrading**
> 1. **Republish your Matomo Tag Manager container** so the updated `Weather` tag is served.
> 2. **If you use the plain JS snippet** (no MTM), copy the updated snippet from `docs/index.md`.

**Matomo 6**
- Compatibility with Matomo 6.x (`>=6.0.0-b1,<7.0.0-b1`)
- Requires PHP 8.1+, MySQL 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.6+
- Update plugin homepage URL
- Visitor log weather card rendered by a Vue component (`WeatherReports.VisitorWeather`) built with Vite, Twig template removed
- `getUserIp` controller action declared with the `#[JsonResponse]` attribute
- Remove the listener of the `CronArchive.getArchivingAPIMethodForPlugin` event, no longer triggered by Matomo

**Tracking**
- fix: weather is added to the tracking requests (page views, events, site searches, links, ecommerce) of every page, a `ping` is only sent when the page view of the page was already tracked. Before, a single ping per browser session was sent: Matomo ignores a ping that would start a new visit, so the weather was lost when the ping reached Matomo first, and visits started later in the same browser session (after 30 minutes of inactivity) had no weather.
- fix: tracking parameters are URL encoded (conditions such as `Pluie & brouillard` were truncated) and missing values are no longer sent as `undefined`
- fix: felt temperature accepts the same range as temperature (-100..200), heat indexes above 100 °F were dropped
- Tag Manager: WeatherAPI response cached one hour in `sessionStorage` and reused on every page, `sessionStorage` errors handled, works when `_paq` is not defined yet
- `getUserIp` endpoint readable from any origin (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`), it only returns the caller's own IP

**Reports**
- Humidity, Pressure and Wind speed displayed as bar charts like the other scale reports
- Unit of the website shown in the label column title, e.g. `Temperature (°C)`
- Report classes share their configuration (category, goal metrics, label translation)

**Visitor log**
- New weather card: condition, temperature and felt temperature, measures grid, wind direction arrow, numbers formatted with the user locale, light and dark themes
- Weather condition no longer displayed with HTML entities (`&amp;`, `&#039;`)

**Tests**
- add: Vitest specs for the card value formatting and wind arrow
- add: PHPUnit tests for unit symbols and the felt temperature range

### v5.2.0

> ⚠️ **Action required after upgrading**
> 1. **Database migration** — Matomo will prompt you to upgrade the schema on activation. `weather_pressure` and `weather_visibility` widen `INT → FLOAT`; `weather_wind_direction` narrows `VARCHAR(255) → VARCHAR(8)`. Existing data is preserved (the 16-point compass is ≤3 chars).
> 2. **Republish your Matomo Tag Manager container.** The bundled `Weather` tag template (`WeatherTag.web.js`) was rewritten — published containers keep serving the old JS until you publish a new version.
> 3. **If you use the plain JS snippet** (no MTM), copy the updated snippet from `docs/index.md` so you also drop the third-party `ipapi.co` call.

**Privacy / data flow**
- remove: third-party `ipapi.co` IP-lookup. The Matomo Tag Manager template now uses WeatherAPI's built-in `q=auto:ip` so visitor IPs are no longer shared with a second service.
- add: public `WeatherReports&action=getUserIp` Controller endpoint as a self-hosted IP-resolution fallback for CDN/proxy setups (uses Matomo's `IP::getIpFromHeader()`, honours `proxy_client_headers`).
- harden: tag JS now bails out cleanly on missing API key, HTTP errors, malformed responses, and unavailable `sessionStorage`.

**Tracking & validation**
- refactor: `Columns/` now share a single `Base` class — ~1,500 lines of duplicated dimension boilerplate replaced by ~200 lines.
- fix: input is type-cast (`int`/`float`/`string`) at the tracker via `Common::getRequestVar` instead of being stored as raw strings.
- fix: out-of-range values are dropped at ingest:
  - Cloud / Humidity: 0-100
  - UV: 0-20
  - Temperature / Felt temperature: -100..200
  - Pressure: 0..2000 (covers both mb and inHg)
  - Visibility / Precipitation / WindSpeed: 0..1000
  - WindDirection: must match the 16-point compass (N, NNE, NE, ENE, …, NNW)
- fix: string columns (Condition, WindDirection) no longer write integer `0` when the request has no value — they store `null`.

**Schema**
- fix: `weather_pressure` is now `FLOAT NULL` (was `INT(10)`) so values in inHg keep precision.
- fix: `weather_visibility` is now `FLOAT NULL` (was `INT(10)`) so values in miles keep precision.
- fix: `weather_wind_direction` is now `VARCHAR(8) NULL` (was `VARCHAR(255)`) — the 16-point compass max is 3 chars.
- A standard Matomo schema migration prompts admins on next activation; existing data is preserved (INT→FLOAT widens losslessly).

**Reports**
- fix: scale reports (Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, …) sort numerically by label so chart x-axes read 1, 2, 10, 20 instead of 1, 10, 2, 20.
- fix: categorical reports (Condition, WindDirection) sort by visit count and no longer collapse all rows into a single `0` bucket from a stray `(float)` cast.
- add: categorical report tables show **top 15** rows + "Others" by default (was Matomo's 5).
- chore: dedupe the rounding closure in `API.php` — six methods now share one `getRoundedScaleDataTable()` helper.

**Visitor log**
- ui: redesigned weather panel as a themed card with a header line (`Weather · Condition` + temperature with felt-temp suffix) and a 2-column metric grid below.
- ui: units (`°C`/`°F`, `mm`/`in`, `mb`/`inHg`, `km`/`mi`, `km/h`/`mph`) are rendered next to each value, read from the existing per-site `MeasurableSettings` (those settings are now actually wired in).
- ui: light/dark theme aware — colors and surfaces use Matomo's CSS variables (`--theme-color-text`, `--theme-color-text-light`, `--theme-color-border`, `--theme-color-background-contrast`) with hex fallbacks. DarkTheme, GoogleTheme and Morpheus all match automatically.
- ui: rows with no recorded value are hidden (no more bare `°C` / `mb` / `%` suffixes); the whole card is skipped if a visit has no weather data at all.
- harden: `renderVisitorDetails` is wrapped in `try/catch` and logs to `tmp/logs/` instead of breaking the visitor log if rendering fails.

**Other**
- fix: removed broken `Live\Model::getCRMData` / `getAdviews` calls in `WeatherReports.php` (copy-paste leftovers from another plugin; methods don't exist).
- chore: deleted dead commented-out `MeasurableSettings::makeWeatherLangSetting` (~50 lines) and empty `config/config.php` / `config/tracker.php`.
- chore: dropped boilerplate example comments from every `Columns/*.php` file.

**Tests**
- add: 53 PHPUnit unit tests covering every column's bounds, type coercion, the 16-point compass validator, and Condition's UTF-8 truncation.
- add: `phpunit.xml` with `Unit` and `Integration` test suites.

**Docs**
- rewritten classic-snippet docs (no more ipapi.co), documented the optional `getUserIp` endpoint, refreshed the dimensions table to reflect the FLOAT migrations, added a privacy note.
